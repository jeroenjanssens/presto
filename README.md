Presto: A Poseidon research tool to create artificial vessel trajectories
=========================================================================

The automatic detection of anomalies in the maritime domain requires representative anomalous instances. Presto is an application that enables maritime-domain experts to create artificial anomalous vessel trajectories, characteristic of traffic violations, illegal fishing activities, drug smuggling, or piracy. When merged with existing real-world data the artificial trajectories enable the application and evaluation of machine learning algorithms for the automatic detection of anomalies.

Presto was developed by Jeroen Janssens during his Ph.D. on outlier selection and one-class classification at [Tilburg University](http://www.tilburguniversity.edu/) for the [Poseidon project](http://www.esi.nl/poseidon/). It was first demonstrated at the 22nd Benelux Conference on Artificial Intelligence:

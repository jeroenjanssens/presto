/**
 * Utility for making deep copies (vs. clone()'s shallow copies) of
 * objects. Objects are first serialized and then deserialized. Error
 * checking is fairly minimal in this implementation. If an object is
 * encountered that cannot be serialized (or that references an object
 * that cannot be serialized) an error is printed to System.err and
 * null is returned. Depending on your specific application, it might
 * make more sense to have copy(...) re-throw the exception.
